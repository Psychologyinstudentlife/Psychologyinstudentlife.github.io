        <!-- Content related to stress management goes here -->

        <p>You were supposed to have a test on Monday so you told yourself
 you’ll certainly study over the weekend. Fast forward to Sunday night, 
you’re sitting with your books open and don’t know where to start so you try to relax by watching that one tiktok/short/reel, and now it’s 2 am, you haven’t gotten any work done, you’re too exhausted to do anything and just the thought of having to deal with studies makes you sick. 
Let’s admit it, we all have faced some form of anxiety before a test whether we realised or not. But what if I tell you could just skip to the good part? 
Let’s rewind.</p>

<p><strong>*it is quite important to notice that you won't maraculously get 3 extra marks in your next exam bu using the following strategies. That doesn't exist. I'm here to tell you, that good grades don't equate to sacrificing mental,physical,or emotional health</strong></p>

		<p><strong>LAST-MINUTE CRAMMING?</strong>
		<br/>
	<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
	Let’s first wrestle with your racing heart when you try to go through the entire course  5 minutes before the test. The answer is pretty simple actually: Early preparation + Structured/Spaced learning. 
The first step to improvement is acceptance. And you have got to admit that it’s very unrealistic to actually sit and study for 12 hours straight and then expect to remember all that you studied. 
The idea here is that you try to study for that subject every other day (or every day if it’s demanding) for 1-2 hours. This will help you stay consistent as you won’t be pressured to cram all the information in one day. It will probably also give you time to watch that pending drama or read that book without feeling guilty! <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information, please visit the following links:<a href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/what-is-spaced-practice/">How to study using the spaced practice method</a> and <a href="https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/effective-studying/spaced-practice.html">spaced method</a>.</p>

      	  <p>-<strong> Practicing relaxation techniques</strong><p>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a long breath, relax your muscles and close your eyes while imagining that you are graduating from Harvard. During exam month sometimes it gets hard to sleep, but deprivation of sleep only enhances the stress. To have a peaceful sleep, listen to classical music or listen to the rhythm of rain, light candles, and think about good memories that enlighten your mood. Just go for a walk and find harmony in nature’s symphony or fire up the treadmill like Barbara in Batman. Quarantining yourself at home is an absolute red flag because our brain needs change in the environment; isolation leads to poorer cognitive function. Do activities that improve your mood like painting, gardening, hiking or shopping ( for girls). Meditation and yoga are psychologically proven methods to reduce stress, as their influence is not limited to mental relief but expands to physical relief.

       	 <p><strong>THE CUP OF RAMEN, THE SHOT OF ESPRESSO AND THE JITTERS
</strong><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I HOPE this may not surprise you but healthy lifestyle choices play a vital role in managing stress. This can include: 
<br>
<br>
- A form of physical exercise that you enjoy whether it’s aggressively jamming to your favourite playlist or a light run, it’ll boost your mood by releasing endorphins and also enhance your cognitive function.
<br>
<br>
- Staying hydrated is another one, but not with coffee, we need water.  Excessive caffeine in the form of coffee, tea, energy drinks and hopefully not drugs can end up increasing your anxiety, making it difficult to stay focussed. Another reminder, caffeine takes several hours to clear up from your system so may mess with your sleep cycle. And lack of sleep can impair your memory and focus, hindering your performance.
<br>
<br>
- Replacing trash-talking with positive self-talk. This can be done by talking to yourself in the mirror or even visualising your success. Life’s graph isn’t linear and your expectations should not be either. 
</p>
<p><strong>Improve your learning method:</strong><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all have different ways to attain the knowledge. The day we ascertain our learning method, will be the day we will find the key to success. Some students obtain knowledge by visualising information, repeating the information again and again verbally, chewing specific flavour of  gum help us remember the information, maybe listening to music helps to focus. The only way you can find out is by trying all the methods. The best learning method that works for all, drumroll please, is “ Spaced learning”.</p>
       	 
       	<p><strong>Reassure yourself: </strong><P>

&nbsp;<strong> “ Believe in yourself, take on your challenges, dig deep within yourself to conquer fears. Never let anyone bring you down. You gotta keep going.” Chantal Sutherland
</strong> <P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing the preparation of the test, forgive your mind and let it rest. Never think you will lose, try to overcome your fears. When we are babies , we fall again and again but then we start walking and no one can stop us because we know that we have incredible stamina to achieve anything. You fail once does not mean history will repeat itself; you are the author of your life and you can change the script.

</p>
        <p><strong>Time managing </strong><P>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not live in Quantum Realm, where time is meaningless like in MCU. We should make a proper timetable and try to follow it throughout the study period. Put time limitations on your social apps and focus on your target. Our heart will always recommend sleeping more and being a couch potato all the time; but we need to listen to our brain recommendations. Try to complete the syllabus at least one week before the exam so you can have time to revise and solve practice papers. Do not completely ignore easier subjects because at the end these subjects will increase your overall GPA. Even studying all day is harmful; our brain needs freedom. Eat a proper diet that provides endorphins that help you cope up with stress. According to some cultures, eating almonds can also have a great impact on memory. Spend time with your friends and family no matter how busy you are because at the end we are social animals.Please pay a visit to the following website for more information <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/missing-manual/high-school/top-time-management-tips-students#:~:text=Set%20out%20specific%20time%20for,2%20pm%20until%205%3A30.">Top time management tips</a></p>
