      	  <p>- One of the key strategies is <strong>early preparation</strong>. Starting your study sessions well in advance allows you to cover the material thoroughly, reducing the need for last-minute cramming. Break down your study material into smaller, manageable portions and create a <strong>structured study schedule</strong> to stay organized. This is known as<strong>spaced practice or distributed practice</strong> . By <strong>"Spaced learning"</strong> activities out over time (for example, 1 to 2 hours every other day, or at least once per week, rather than a 12-hour marathon cramming session), you will be able to learn more information and retain it longer.For more information, please visit the following links:<a href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/what-is-spaced-practice/">How to study using the spaced practice method</a> and <a href="https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/effective-studying/spaced-practice.html">spaced method</a>.</p>

      	  <p>-<strong> Practicing relaxation techniques</strong> such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, especially during study breaks, can significantly improve your focus and overall well-being.How to, you ask?, please visit this site: <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/therese-borchard-sanity-break/10-quick-ways-to-calm-down/" target="_blank">Ways to calm yourself down</a></p>

       	 <p>-<strong> Healthy lifestyle choices</strong> play a vital role in managing stress. Regular physical activity not only boosts your mood by releasing endorphins but also enhances your cognitive function. Additionally, maintain a balanced diet and <strong>stay hydrated</strong>. Avoid excessive caffeine and sugar, as they can increase anxiety levels.</p>

       	 <p>- When it comes to <strong>studying techniques</strong>, consider using active learning methods such as flashcards, summarization, and teaching the material to others. Engage in <strong>practice exams or quizzes</strong> to familiarize yourself with the exam format and assess your knowledge. Don’t forget to <strong>get adequate sleep</strong> before the exam. Lack of sleep can impair your memory and focus, hindering your performance.</p>

       	 <p>- Moreover, <strong>positive self-talk</strong> can make a significant difference. Replace self-doubt with positive affirmations. Believe in your abilities and remind yourself of your past accomplishments. Visualize your success to boost your confidence.</p>

       	 <p>- If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to <strong>seek support</strong>. Talk to your friends, family, or teachers about your concerns. Sometimes, sharing your feelings can provide immense relief. Participating in a <strong>study group</strong> can also provide a sense of camaraderie and support.</p>

        <p>- <strong>Effective time management</strong> is another crucial aspect. Allocate specific time slots for studying, breaks, and relaxation. Avoid overloading yourself with study material. Be realistic about what you can achieve within a given timeframe. Practice <strong>mindfulness</strong> to stay present and focused during your study sessions.Please pay a visit to the following website for more information <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/missing-manual/high-school/top-time-management-tips-students#:~:text=Set%20out%20specific%20time%20for,2%20pm%20until%205%3A30.">Top time management tips</a></p>
